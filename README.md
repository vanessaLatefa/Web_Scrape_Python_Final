# Web_Scrape

Web_Scrape is a final python project, that scrapes through a website given by our teacher.
I've decided to ask a number in the UI from the user. This program will then generate a readme file that has the important text, I've considered relevant for the user.

## Installation

I've already generated all the necessary libraries being used in this project inside 
requirements.txt
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install this project, inside a virtual environment.


```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After you run the project, 
1) You can then enter a desired number,
    From 1-4, which I set as int
    If you also put any value, other than int.. it will throw a ValueError
    Ask the number again, until it gets a match.

2)  After this, the program will loop through all the contents,
3)  Print the desired content I setted
4)  And save it to a markdown file.
5)  The program will also print the contents in the terminal,
    So you don't need to check the mardown file.

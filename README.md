# Web_Scrape

Web_Scrape is a final python project, that scrapes through a website given by our teacher.
I've decided to ask a number in the UI from the user. This program will then generate a readme file that has the important text, I've considered relevant for the user.

## Installation

I've already generated all the necessary libraries being used in this project inside

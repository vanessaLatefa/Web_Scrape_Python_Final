CRAWL A WEB SITE AND SAVE THE CONTENT IN MARKDOWN
Choose a website of your own choice or use this website
            crawl it and "scrape" it.
The content of the website should be saved in markdown formatted files on your computer.
It can be a good idea to choose a relatively small website.
It can also be a good idea to have some sort of limit on which links you want to follow.
        
What you choose to retrieve from the crawled site is up to you. But you should describe why you choose to do
            like you did.
